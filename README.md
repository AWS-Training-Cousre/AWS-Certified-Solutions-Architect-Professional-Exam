# Experience with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional Exam

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional credential is now one of the most sought-after designations in Cloud Computing. Many people currently hold fundamental and associate-level certificates, but the number drops dramatically for the professional level. And there's a reason behind it. The certification [AWS Solutions Architect Professional] is a challenging exam that evaluates in-depth AWS knowledge and expertise with how AWS services may be utilized together.

The Professional AWS Certified Solutions Architect — exam consists of the following sections:

There are 75 multiple-choice and multiple-response questions.

180-minute completion time with a 75% pass rate

With a bit of simple arithmetic, you can easily calculate that you have around 2 1/2 minutes to finish each question. That may be plenty of time for simpler certifications, but if you've seen samples of professional-level AWS test questions, you'll know they may be lengthy and complex. With a more excellent pass mark than the associate levels, completing this test is a difficult challenge.

### My Exam Experiential

In this post, you'll discover what to anticipate, and I aim to reassure you that it is quite attainable with the proper preparation while it may seem complicated (and it is). I recently completed the test with 945 points out of 1000, so with only a few mistakes out of 75 questions, I'm relatively pleased to report I passed with a respectable margin.
I'll now offer an overview of the test, beginning with a look at the sorts of questions you'll encounter on the exam and the issue of time management (which is exceptionally essential), before going on to a more in-depth look at the exam's actual substance.

### Types of Questions

The Professional AWS Certified Solutions Architect — test guide offers two categories of exam questions:

There is one correct response and three wrong replies in a multiple choice question (distractors).

Multiple responses: Has two or more accurate answers from a set of five or more alternatives.

In actuality, there are three major types of questions:
•	Questions with one correct answer
•	Questions with two correct answers
•	Questions with three accurate solutions

On average, you may expect a dozen or so questions with two answers and half a dozen with three solutions. Don't be concerned about the number of responses you must provide; it's not a good indicator of question complexity. If anything, I've discovered that questions with three answers are sometimes the easiest to answer (though this isn't always the case!).

You should also be aware that there will frequently be many valid answers for professional-level questions. You must pick the best response based on the criteria specified in the question. For example, the question may ask you to select the most cost-effective alternative, the option that needs the least operational or maintenance work, or the response that provides the highest availability or performance. Always make sure you understand precisely what the situation requires. 

### Length of Question

Questions might be either long or very brief. Answers might either be long or short. This is another example of how you must approach the exam with the proper mentality. Try not to be concerned with the length of the question since more extended questions and lengthier responses can give additional information that can assist you in making the optimal decision.

Also, try to eliminate fluff; lengthier questions frequently contain extraneous material with no direct bearing. Learn how to rapidly identify essential facts and needs and extract what you need to make your decision.

### Time Administration

This is one of the most significant success elements. You must be very aware of the time. The ultimate thing you need to do is get down to the wire and realize you still have a bunch of difficult questions to answer! Being mindful of the time and avoiding the need to rush towards the end can positively influence. When we are anxious, and under time constraints, we tend to make more mistakes.

It's worth noting that the difficulty level of the questions might vary quite a bit. I found myself getting through several questions fast and then needing to spend a few minutes on specific questions that were more unclear or difficult to answer.

Another suggestion is to avoid devoting too much time to questions when undecided about the best response. Consider it carefully, make your choice, and mark it for review. You may then return after the exam and spend a little more time with less pressure. I still had about 30 minutes left in my [AWS exam] to go back and verify some of the answers I had highlighted for revision.
